# DNN Connect 2022 Demo Code

This repo is the project I used to demonstrate CodeGen and Dnn.CakeUtils.

## Demo runs

Simply run ```codegen``` to generate DAL code. Note, you'll probably need to adjust the .codegen.json file to point to the right database.

Run ```\.build.ps1``` to build the project to a DNN package.
